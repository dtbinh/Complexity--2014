	Annote = {An exploratory technique is introduced for investigating how much of the irregularity in an aperiodic time series is due to low dimensional chaotic dynamics, as opposed to stochastic or high dimensional dynamics. Non-linear models are constructed with a variable smoothing parameter which at one extreme defines a non-linear deterministic model, and at the other extreme defines a linear stochastic model. The accuracy of the resulting short-term forecasts as a function of the smoothing parameter reveals much about the underlying dynamics generating the time series. The technique is applied to a variety of experimental and naturally occuring time series data, and the results are compared with dimension calculations.},

@article{Canova1995,
	Abstract = { This paper introduces Lagrange multiplier tests of the null hypothesis of no unit roots at seasonal frequencies against the alternative of a unit root at either a single seasonal frequency or a set of seasonal frequencies. The tests complement those of D. Dickey, D. Hasza, and W. Fuller (1984) and S. Hylleberg, et al. (1990), which examine the null of seasonal unit roots. The authors derive an asymptotic distribution theory for the tests and investigate their size and power with a Monte Carlo exercise. Application of three sets of seasonal variables shows that, in most cases, seasonality is nonstationary.},

@article{KPSSunit,
	Abstract = {The standard conclusion that is drawn from this empirical evidence is that many or most aggregate economic time series contain a unit root. However, it is important to note that in this empirical work the unit root is set up as the null hypothesis testing is carried out ensures that the null hypothesis is accepted unless there is strong evidence against it. Therefore, an alternative explanation for the common failure to reject a unit root is simply that most economic time series are not very informative about whether or not there is a unit root; or, equivalently, that standard unit root tests are not very powerful against relevant alternatives.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

@article{akaike1974,
	Abstract = {{The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.}},

The aim of this study is to analyse whether this also holds for selected currencies of the CEE region as the literature relating to the ability of forecasting these exchange rates is scarce. We tackle this issue by comparing the random walk based out-of-sample forecast errors of the Polish zloty, the Czech koruna and the Hungarian forint exchange rates against the euro with the corresponding errors generated by various single- and multi-equation models of these exchange rates. The results confirm that it is very difficult to outperform a simple random walk model in our CEE currencies forecasting contest.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical formulations of the embedding methods commonly used for the reconstruction of attractors from data series are discussed. Embedding theorems, based on previous work by H. Whitney and F. Takens, are established for compact subsetsA of Euclidean space Rk. Ifn is an integer larger than twice the box-counting dimension ofA, then almost every map fromRk toRn, in the sense of prevalence, is one-to-one onA, and moreover is an embedding on smooth manifolds contained withinA. IfA is a chaotic attractor of a typical dynamical system, then the same is true for almost everydelay-coordinate map fromRk toRn. These results are extended in two other directions. Similar results are proved in the more general case of reconstructions which use moving averages of delay coordinates. Second, information is given on the self-intersection set that exists whenn is less than or equal to twice the box-counting dimension ofA.},
