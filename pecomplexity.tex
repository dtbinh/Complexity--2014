\begin{abstract}
  Computers are deterministic dynamical systems \cite{mytkowicz09}.
  Among other things, that implies that one should be able to use
  deterministic forecast rules to predict aspects of their behavior.
  That statement is sometimes---but not always---true. The memory and
  processor loads of some simple programs are easy to predict, for
  example, but those of more-complex programs like {\tt gcc} are not.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% I had to change all the \verb|blah| entries because they caused
%% latex to barf if they were in figure captions.  Odd bug.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  The goal of this paper is to determine why that is the case. We
  conjecture that, in practice, complexity can effectively overwhelm
  the predictive power of deterministic forecast models. To explore
  that, we build models of a number of performance traces from
  different programs running on different Intel-based computers. We
  then calculate the \emph{permutation entropy}---a temporal entropy
  metric that uses ordinal analysis---of those traces and correlate
  those values against the prediction success.

\section{Introduction}
%\begin{it}
%Paragraph on computer performance, including citations to Todd paper
%and summary of the results that indicate that they're deterministic
%nonlinear dynamical systems.  Given that, we should be able to
%predict.  What benefits would accrue if we could do so: power mgmt,
%end world hunger [[this is my primary goal everyday :)]], etc.
%\end{it}
Things to add to introduction
\begin{enumerate}
\item Differnt kinds of complexity exist in time series and this makes choosing prediction models difficult 
\item When deterministic structure even complex structure exists that structure can be utilized for prediction. 
\item For noisy real-valued time series distinguishing randomness (WN,RW) complexity from structured nonlinear / chaotic /high period / high dimensional etc complexity is often impossible. 

\item Make an argument that Computer Performance is a great testing ground as it omits signals that completely cover the spectrum of complexity \col \dots \gcc

\item Introduce the two main contributions of the paper which are outlined at the begining of the results section

\end{enumerate}



Computers are among the most complex engineered artifacts in current
use.  Modern microprocessor chips contain multiple processing units
and multi-layer memories, for instance, and they use complicated
hardware/software strategies to move data and threads of computation
across those resources.  These features---along with all the others
that go into the design of these chips---make the patterns of their
processor loads and memory accesses highly complex and hard to
predict.  Accurate forecasts of these quantities, if one could
construct them, could be used to improve computer design.  If one
could predict that a particular computational thread would be bogged
down for the next 0.6 seconds waiting for data from main memory, for
instance, one could save power by putting that thread on hold for that
time period (e.g., by migrating it to a processing unit whose clock
speed is scaled back).  Computer performance traces are, however, very
complex.  Even a simple ``microkernel,'' like a three-line loop that
repeatedly initializes a matrix in column-major order, can produce
{\sl chaotic} performance traces \cite{mytkowicz09}, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:col-ts}, and chaos places fundamental limits on
predictability.

The computer systems community has applied a variety of prediction
strategies to traces like this, most of which employ regression.  An
appealing alternative builds on the recently established fact that
computers can be effectively modeled as deterministic nonlinear
dynamical systems \cite{mytkowicz09}.  This result implies the
existence of a deterministic forecast rule for those dynamics.  In
particular, one can use \emph{delay-coordinate embedding} to
reconstruct the underlying dynamics of computer performance, then use
the resulting model to forecast the future values of computer
performance metrics such as memory or processor loads
\cite{josh-ida2011}.  In the case of simple microkernels like the one
that produced the trace in Figure~\ref{fig:ipc}, this deterministic
modeling and forecast strategy works very well.  In more-complicated
programs, however, such as speech recognition software or compilers,
this forecast strategy---as well as the traditional methods---break
down quickly.

This paper is a first step in understanding when, why, and how
deterministic forecast strategies fail when they are applied to
deterministic systems.  We focus here on the specific example of
computer performance.  We conjecture that the complexity of traces
from these systems---which results from the inherent dimension,
non-linearity, and non-stationarity of the dynamics, as well as from
measurement issues like noise, aggregation, and finite data
length---can make those deterministic signals \emph{effectively}
unpredictable.  We argue that \emph{permutation entropy}
\cite{bandt2002per}, a method for measuring the entropy of a
real-valued-finite-length time series through ordinal analysis, is an
effective way to explore that conjecture.  We study four
examples---two simple microkernels and two complex programs from the
SPEC benchmark suite---running on different Intel-based machines.  For
each program, we calculate the permutation entropy of the processor
load (instructions per cycle) and memory-use efficiency (cache-miss
rates), then compare that to the prediction accuracy attainable for
that trace using a simple deterministic model.

% paragraph to appease the theoretician in me
It is worth taking a moment to consider the theoretical possibility of
this task. We are not attempting to predict the state of the CPU at an
arbitrary point in the future --- this, at least with perfect
accuracy, would be tantamount to solving the halting problem. What we
are attempting is to predict aspects or functions of the running of
the CPU: instructions executed per second, cache misses per 100,000
instructions, and similar statistics. Prediction of these quantities
at some finite time in the future, even with perfect accuracy, does
not violate the Rice-Shapiro theorem.

% The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
% Section~\ref{sec:compModel} describes the experimental setup, as well
% as the nonlinear modeling and forecast strategies.  In
% Section~\ref{sec:meaComplex}, we review permutation entropy, calculate
% its value for a number of different computer performance traces, and
% compare the results to the prediction accuracy.  In
% Section~\ref{sec:conc}, we discuss these results and their
% implications in regard to our conjecture, and consider future areas of
% research.

% \subsection{Reconstructing hidden dynamics}

Delay-coordinate embedding allows one to reconstruct a system's full
state-space dynamics from a \emph{single} scalar time-series
measurement---provided that some conditions hold regarding that data.
Specifically, if the underlying dynamics and the measurement
function---the mapping from the unknown state vector $\vec{X}$ to the
scalar value $x$ that one is measuring---are both smooth and generic,
Takens~\cite{takens} formally proves that the delay-coordinate map
\[
F(\tau,m)(x) = ([x(t) ~ x(t+\tau) ~ \dots ~x(t+m\tau)])
\]
from a $d$-dimensional smooth compact manifold $M$ to ${Re}^{2d+1}$,
where $t$ is time, is a diffeomorphism on $M$---in other words, that
the reconstructed dynamics and the true (hidden) dynamics have the
same topology.

This is an extremely powerful result: among other things, it means
that one can build a formal model of the full system dynamics without
measuring (or even knowing) every one of its state variables.  This is
the foundation of the modeling approach that is used in this paper.
The first step in the process is to estimate values for the two free
parameters in the delay-coordinate map: the delay $\tau$ and the
dimension $m$.  We follow standard procedures for this, choosing the
first minimum in the average mutual information as an estimate of
$\tau$ \cite{fraser-swinney} and using the false-near(est) neighbor
method of \cite{KBA92}, with a threshold of 10\%, to estimate $m$.  A
plot of the data from Figure~\ref{fig:ipc}, embedded following this
procedure, is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:embedding}.

   \centering
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/colipc3d.png}
     \caption{A 3D projection of a delay-coordinate embedding of the trace

 \end{figure}


%% can cut for space if need be:
The coordinates of each point on this plot are differently delayed
elements of the \verb|col_major| L2 cache miss rate time series
$y(t)$: that is, $y(t)$ on the first axis, $y(t+\tau)$ on the second,
$y(t+2\tau)$ on the third, and so on.
%% ...down to here.
Structure in these kinds of plots---clearly visible in
Figure~\ref{fig:embedding}---is an indication of
determinism\footnote{A deeper analysis of
  Figure~\ref{fig:embedding}---as alluded to on the previous
  page---supports that diagnosis, confirming the presence of a chaotic
  attractor in these cache-miss dynamics, with largest Lyapunov
  exponent $\lambda_1 = 8000 \pm 200$ instructions, embedded in a
  12-dimensional reconstruction space \cite{mytkowicz09}.}.  That
structure can also be used to build a forecast model.

% \subsection{LMA: Using dynamics in forecasting}

Given a nonlinear model of a deterministic dynamical system in the
form of a delay-coordinate embedding like Figure~\ref{fig:embedding},
one can build deterministic forecast algorithms by capturing and
exploiting the geometry of the embedding.  Many techniques have been
developed by the dynamical systems community for this purpose
(e.g.,~\cite{casdagli-eubank92,weigend-book}).  Perhaps the most straightforward
is the ``Lorenz method of analogues'' (LMA), which is essentially
nearest-neighbor prediction in the embedded state
space~\cite{lorenz-analogues}.  Even this simple algorithm---which
builds predictions by finding the nearest neighbor in the embedded
space of the given point, then taking that neighbor's path as the
forecast---works quite well on the trace in Figure~\ref{fig:ipc}, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cachePredTS}.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/colCachePredTS}
    \caption{A forecast of the last 4,000 points of the signal in
      Figure~\ref{fig:ipc} using an LMA-based strategy on the
      embedding in Figure~\ref{fig:embedding}.  Red circles and blue
      $\times$s are the true and predicted values, respectively;
      vertical bars show where these values differ. }
\label{fig:cachePredTS}
\end{figure}
%
On the other hand, if we use the same approach to forecast the
processor load\footnote{Instructions per cycle, or IPC} of the {\tt
  482.sphinx3} program from the SPEC cpu2006 benchmark suite, running
on an Intel i7\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-based machine, the
prediction is far less accurate; see Figure~\ref{fig:predsphinx}.
%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/sphinxPredicTS}
     \caption{An LMA-based forecast of the last 4,000 points of a
       processor-load performance trace from the {\tt 482.sphinx3}

       predicted values, respectively; vertical bars show where these
       values differ.}
\label{fig:predsphinx}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:PredError} presents detailed results about the
prediction accuracy of this algorithm on four different examples: the
{\tt col\_major} and {\tt 482.sphinx3} programs in
Figures~\ref{fig:cachePredTS} and~\ref{fig:predsphinx}, as well as
another simple microkernel that initializes the same matrix as {\tt
  col\_major}, but in row-major order, and another complex program
({\tt 403.gcc}) from the SPEC cpu2006 benchmark suite.  Both
microkernels were run on the Intel Core
Duo\textsuperscript{\textregistered} machine; both SPEC benchmarks
were run on the Intel i7\textsuperscript{\textregistered} machine.  We
calculated a figure of merit for each prediction as follows.  We held
back the last $k$ elements\footnote{Several different prediction
  horizons were analyzed in our experiment; the results reported in
  this paper are for $k$=4000} of the $N$ points in each measured time
series, built the forecast model by embedding the first $N-k$ points,
used that embedding and the LMA method to predict the next $k$ points,
then computed the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the true and
predicted signals:
$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^k(c_i-\hat{p_i})^2}{k}}$$
%
To compare the success of predictions across signals with different
units, we normalized RMSE as follows:
$$nRMSE = \frac{RMSE}{X_{max,obs}-X_{min,obs}}$$
%
% The smaller the nRMSE, obviously, the more accurate the prediction.



The results in Table~\ref{tab:PredError} show a clear distinction
between the two microkernels, whose future behavior can be
predicted effectively using this simple deterministic modeling
strategy, and the more-complex SPEC benchmarks, for which this
prediction strategy does not work nearly as well.
% Removed for space
% For both processor load (IPC) and memory usage (cache-miss rate),
% forecasts for {\tt 482.sphinx3} and {\tt 403.gcc} are much worse than
% for \verb|col_major| or \verb|row_major|.
%
This begs the question: If these traces all come from deterministic
systems---computers---then why are they not equally predictable?  Our
conjecture is that the sheer complexity of the dynamics of the SPEC
benchmarks running on the Intel i7\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
machine make them effectively impossible to predict.

%% entropy to explore that conjecture.]]

\section{Measuring Complexity}\label{sec:meaComplex}

For the purposes of this paper, one can view entropy as a measure of complexity
and predictability in a time series.  A high-entropy time series is almost
completely unpredictable---and conversely.  This can be made more rigorous:
Pesin's relation \cite{pesin77} states that in chaotic dynamical systems, the
Shannon entropy rate is equal to the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents,
$\lambda_i$. The Lyapunov exponents directly quantify the rate at which nearby
states of the system will diverge with time: $\left| \Delta x(t) \right| \approx
e^{\lambda t} \left| \Delta x(0) \right|$.  The faster the divergence, the more
difficult prediction becomes.

Utilizing entropy as a measure of temporal complexity is by no means a new idea
\cite{Shannon1951, mantegna1994linguistic}.  Its effective usage requires
categorical data: $x_t \in \mathcal{S}$ for some finite or countably infinite
\emph{alphabet} $\mathcal{S}$, whereas data taken from real-world systems is
effectively real-valued.  To get around this, one must discretize the data---
typically achieved by binning.  Unfortunately, this is rarely a good solution to
the problem, as the binning of the values introduces an additional dynamic on
top of the intrinsic dynamics whose entropy is desired.  The field of symbolic
dynamics studies how to discretize a time series in such a way that the
intrinsic behavior is not perverted, but these methods are fragile in the face
of noise and require further understanding of the underlying system, which
defeats the purpose of measuring the entropy in the first place.

Bandt and Pompe introduced the \emph{permutation entropy} (PE) as a ``natural
complexity measure for time series" \cite{bandt2002per}.  Permutation entropy
employs a method of discretizing real-valued time series that follows the
intrinsic behavior of the system under examination.  Rather than looking at the
statistics of sequences of values, as is done when computing the Shannon
entropy, permutation entropy looks at the statistics of the \emph{orderings} of
sequences of values using ordinal analysis. Ordinal analysis of a time series is
the process of mapping successive time-ordered elements of a time series to
their value-ordered permutation of the same size.  By way of example, if $(x_1,
x_2, x_3) = (9, 1, 7)$ then its \emph{ordinal pattern}, $\phi(x_1, x_2, x_3)$,
is $231$ since $x_2 \leq x_3 \leq x_1$.  This method has many features; among
other things, it is generally robust to observational noise and requires no
knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.

\begin{mydef}[Permutation Entropy]

  Given a time series $\{x_t\}_{t = 1,\dots,T}$. Define $\mathcal{S}_n$ as all
  $n!$ permutations $\pi$ of order $n$. For each $\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n$ we
  determine the relative frequency of that permutation occurring in $\{x_t\}_{t
  = 1,\dots,T}$:
  \begin{align*}
    p(\pi) = \frac{\left|\{t|t \leq T-n,\phi(x_{t+1},\dots,x_{t+n}) = \pi\}\right|}{T-n+1}
  \end{align*}
  Where $|\cdot|$ is set cardinality. The \emph{permutation entropy} of order $n
  \ge 2$ is defined as
  \begin{align*}
  H(n) = - \sum_{\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n} p(\pi) \log_2 p(\pi)
  \end{align*}

\end{mydef}

Notice that $0\le H(n) \le \log_2(n!)$ \cite{bandt2002per}.  With this in mind,
it is common in the literature to normalize permutation entropy as follows:
$\frac{H(n)}{\log_2(n!)}$.  With this convention, ``low'' entropy is close to 0
and ``high'' entropy is close to 1. Finally, it should be noted that the
permutation entropy has been shown to be identical to the Shannon entropy for
many large classes of systems \cite{amigo2012permutation}.

Here we will be utilizing a variation of the permutation entropy, the
\emph{weighted permutation entropy} (WPE)~\cite{fadlallah2013}. The weighted
permutation entropy attempts to correct for observational noise which is larger
than some trends in the data, but smaller than the larger scale features --- for
example, a signal that switches between two fixed points with noise about those
fixed points. The weighted permutation entropy would be dominated by the
switching rather than by the stochastic fluctuation. To accomplish this, the
\emph{weight} of a permutation is taken into account:
\begin{align*}
  w(x_{t+1:t+n}) = \frac{1}{n}
                 \sum_{x_i \in \{x_{t+1:t+n}\}}
                 \left( x_i - \bar{x}_{t+1:t+n} \right)^2
\end{align*}
where $x_{t+1:t+n}$ is a sequence of values $x_{t+1}, \ldots, x_{t+n}$, and
$\bar{x}_{t+1:t+n}$ is the arithmetic mean of those values.

The weighted probability of a permutation is then:
\begin{align*}
  p_w(\pi) = \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{t \le T - n} w(x_{t+1:t+n}) \cdot \delta(\phi(x_{t:t+n}), \pi) }{\displaystyle \sum_{t \le T - n} w(x_{t+1:t+n})}
\end{align*}
where $\delta(x, y)$ is 1 if $x = y$ and 0 otherwise. Effectively, this weighted
probability enhances permutations involved in ``large'' features and demotes
permutations which are small in amplitude relative to the features of the time
series. The weighted permutation entropy is then:
\begin{align*}
  H_w(n) = - \sum_{\pi \in \mathcal{S}_n} p_w(\pi) \log_2 p_w(\pi),
\end{align*}
which can also be normalized by dividing by $\log_2(n!)$, and will be in all the
results of this paper.

In practice, calculating permutation entropy and weighted permutation entropy
involves choosing a good value for the word length $n$. The primary
consideration is that the value be large enough that forbidden ordinals are
discovered, yet small enough that reasonable statistics over the ordinals are
gathered: e.g.:
\begin{align*}
  n = \operatornamewithlimits{argmax}_\ell \{ T \gtrapprox 100 \ell! \},
\end{align*}
assuming an average of 100 counts per ordinal is sufficient. In the literature,
$3 \le n \le 6$ is a standard choice --- generally without any formal
justification. In theory, the permutation entropy should reach an asymptote with
increasing $n$, but that requires an arbitrarily long time series. In practice,
what one should do is calculate the \emph{persistent} permutation entropy by
increasing $n$ until the result converges, but data length issues can intrude
before that convergence is reached.

The weighted permutation entropy for the {\tt SVD} program is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:wwpe}. To generate this image a window of 5,000 values slid over
the time series. Within each of those windows, the statistics over words of
length 4 are computed and the WPE is calculated. The gray bands denote regions
where the 5,000 value window overlapped visually-distinct regimes. It can be
seen that the behaviors of the weighted permutation entropy vary between
regimes. [[I think here it would be good to add a paragraph explaining the windowed WPE was used for regime choices on SVD...emphasizing  that over a time series permutation entropy fluctuates illustrating within a single time series different levels of complexity and predictability exist. Maybe point at some of the predicting predictability papers.]]

In this section we will validate the two key findings of this work:

[[Rephrase these]]
\begin{enumerate}

\item The existence of predictable structure in noisy real-valued time series is quantifiable by WPE and as a result WPE is correlated with prediction accuracy (MASE)  

\subitem WPE can quantify when a noisy real-valued time series is predictable.[[I am unsatisfied with predictable in this sentence, need a better word to say "better than random walk" or ``able to be forecast effectively" or ``has the structural capacity to transmit information in a way that the time series can be effectively forecast"

%\item The existence of complex structure in a noisy real-valued time series is quantifiable and this type of complexity is directly correlated with predictability

\item The way structure/information/complexity is processed internally by a given process plays a crucial role in predictability.
\subitem We will have shown that the existence whether linear or nonlinear is picked up on with WPE but this point gets at whether the prediction model can use the structure or not (linear can't use nonlinear structure). The right to left shifts in \col and some of the \svd regimes and the lack of shift in \gcc illustrate this nicely.

\subitem This is the linear vs nonliear vs random we see with the right to left shifts with lower complexity time series. 

 
\end{enumerate}








%\item Introduce MASE and explain why random walk isn't *that* naive
%\item Paragraph on how to interpret MASE


%As a figure of merit we calculate the Mean Absolute Squared Error (MASE) for each forecast.

In order to analyze correctness of each prediction we split each time series into two pieces: the first 90\% referred to as the ``learning" or ``training" signal, $\{X_{i,obs}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and the last 10\% known as the ``test" or ``correct" signal $\{c_j\}_{j=n+1}^{k+n+1}$. The learning signal is used to train an initial model (e.g., LMA or ARIMA) as described in Section \ref{sec:compModel}. The test signal is used both to assess the models forecasting accuracy and for any refitting that may be necessary. In particular, we perform $k$ 1-step predictions, after each 1-step prediction we append the training signal with the next point in the correct signal $c_j$, refit the model taking into account the new system measurement and perform another prediction. This is repeated $k$ times to obtain $\{p_j\}_{j=n+1}^{k+n+1}$.\footnote{We would like to note that this rebuilding occurs due to a problem with ARIMA models converging to a mean prediction if too long of a prediction horizon is used, this is not a handicap of either LMA or na\"ive.}

As a figure of merit we calculate the Mean Absolute Squared Error (MASE)\cite{MASE} between the true and predicted signals: 
%In order to compare the resulting forecasts we calculate the Mean Absolute Squared Error (MASE)\cite{MASE} between the true and predicted signals:
$$MASE = \sum_{j=n+1}^{k+n+1}\frac{|c_j-p_j| }{\frac{k}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=2}|X_{i,obs}-X_{i-1,obs}|}$$
The scaling term for MASE:
$$\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=2}|X_{i,obs}-X_{i-1,obs}|$$ 
is the average in-sample forecast error for a random walk prediction $(p_i=X_{i-1,obs})$. This error method was introduced in \cite{MASE} as a ``generally applicable measurement of forecast accuracy without the problems seen in the other measurements." The major advantage of MASE is that it allows fair comparison across methods, prediction horizons and varying signal scales. When a forecast results in a $MASE<1$ this means that the prediction method gave, on average, smaller errors than the 1-step errors from the in-sample random walk forecast strategy. Analogously, $MASE>1$ means that the prediction method did worse, on average than the 1-step errors for the in-sample random walk forecast strategy. In Table \ref{tab:error} we provide the distribution [[Joshua: Ryan, Is this the right word? we give mean $\pm$ std. dev but some have very skewed right tails]]  of MASEs for each of the 8 signals and 3 prediction strategies, these are averaged over 15 runs of each type (signal + method). For comparison Table \ref{tab:error} also has the distribution of weighted permutation entropies for word lengths of $l=5$ and $l=6$.

%\item First paragraph: WPE is a good measure of predictability.  Figure:
%best athlete MASE vs. its WPE. 

As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:error} the relationship between prediction accuracy and the weighted permutation entropy (WPE) is much as we conjectured: performance traces with high WPE are
indeed harder to predict using the forecasting models described in Section \ref{sec:compModel}. Figure~\ref{fig:pred_vs_ent} demonstrates this primary finding, with
the exception of one outlier whose behavior we will explain. In Figure~\ref{fig:pred_vs_ent} we plot the best prediction (i.e., the lowest MASE over all 3 methods over all runs of that program) for each of the 8 signals.  

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figs/prediction_vs_entropy}
  \caption{The best MASE among all runs and prediction methods vs weighted
  permutation entropy. For each of these, the word length used is $6$. The
  dashed line is a least-squares linear fit of all the points except for {\tt
  SVD$_1$} which we have excluded for reasons explained in the text.}
  \label{fig:pred_vs_wpe}
\end{figure}
We find that the relationship between the two is roughly linear. The single
outlier, \svd regime 1, does not fit the trend due to a weakness in the WPE:
namely that in the absence of any large features, as all the other regimes have,
the WPE effectively falls back to the standard PE which the noisy behavior
drives toward 1.0.



It may be tempting to paraphrase this primary finding as: ``Signals that are more complex are harder to predict.", but this truly misses the impact of this work. A more correct statement would be ``Time series which exhibit structure-less complexity are harder to predict for any model which uses structure as it's information processor. " [[I don't like this at all]] 

\begin{itemize}
\item Complexity need not be hard to predict (can point at the simple predictions paper)
\item random walk for example is best predicted by guess what just happend
\item The kind of complexity present matters, i.e., that is whether the complexity is structured or not. 
\item Quantifying structured and unstructured complexity is nontrivial in the case of real-valued noisy time series but WPE does this.
\item Maybe plot a big chunk of \col and a big chunk of \gcc together and show that they both look complex. 

\item \gcc appears visually very complex, *and* according to WPE this complexity is unstructured. And a constant, linear and nonlinear prediction strategy all fail. We should be able to conclude that guessing random values is the best we can do as is shown by MASE

\item \col is also complex (can even be chaotic/ point to CHAOS paper) but the complexity is structured according to WPE and as such that complexity is usable for prediction

\item \col brings about the point nicely that some prediction strategies cannot utilize the processes internal information transfer method. That is a nonlinear internal information transfer system cannot be predicted effectively with a linear strategy. This gives a practitioner leverage on when to give up and when to keep working.

\end{itemize}



Of course a complex signal is harder to predict than a trivial one, but this is \emph{not} the core contribution of this work as we will elucidate with Figure \ref{fig:lma_vs_arima}. [[Joshua: Make sure we make it clear WPE not only tells you when there is strucure to use but also what kinds of complexity are usable. e.g., white noise and deterministic chaos are both complex but one is predictable. The kind of complexity is important. Talk about chaos and random walk being complex but from a predictive standpoint that complexity spectrum is important **AND** quantifiable by WPE ]]

\end{figure} 
In Figures~\ref{fig:lma_pred_vs_ent} and \ref{fig:arima_pred_vs_ent} we directly
compare the performance of the LMA and ARIMA prediction methods (respectively)
to the value of the weighted permutation entropy for all runs of each program
under consideration. The LMA MASE values are largely similar to those of the
best predictions, primarily because LMA often performed superior to ARIMA (and
the na\"ive method). On the other hand, the ARIMA MASE values are largely
uncorrelated with WPE values. The fact that ARIMA is uncorrelated with WPE is in large part one of the major findings of this work. More specifically, say we tried to predict an arbitrary noisy real-valued time series with an ``out-of-the-box" prediction strategy like ARIMA as proposed in \cite{autoArima} and say we got inconsistent and bad forecasts, (i.e., perform worse than the na\"ive random walk strategy (MASE$>1$). How do we determine if the prediction
strategy is not adequate for the prediction task, or if the signal is simply too
complex to predict. If a signal is too complex and too little forward information transfer is present we may not be able to do better than the random walk, in which case we should not worry ourselves over finding a more complicated prediction strategy. However, if we measure the complexity to be low, $\textrm{WPE}<0.85$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:pred_vs_wpe}) we can most likely do much better than the random walk and should search for more adequate prediction strategies. 






By way of example, consider \col (the blue +s in
Figure~\ref{fig:predictions_vs_wpe}). If we use the out-of-the-box ARIMA from \cite{autoArima} we get MASE ranging from $\sim0.5$ to
$\sim1.0$.  From that information we may assume that the best predictions that
can be done are twice as good as random-walk, and in some cases predictions will
only do as well as random-walk. In the latter such cases, the random-walk
prediction strategy is probably the best bet as it is so simple and produces
very similar error. However, if we calculate the WPE we see that \col has a WPE
of $0.5131 \pm 0.0034$. This incredibly low entropy implies a great deal of
deterministic structure which can be utilize for prediction, even though this
did not appear to be the case with ARIMA. In fact using LMA on this signal we
get an average MASE value of $0.05\pm0.0018$, an error that is on average 20
times better than the random walk forecast, and 10 times better than the best
ARIMA forcast, with little variance. Alternatively, we can look at the other end
of the spectrum: \gcc. This signal has a WPE of $0.9430\pm0.0013$ and each
prediction method we applied was significantly out performed by a simple random
walk (the best strategy in the case of structureless time series). Since \gcc
has such little structure according to WPE it is safe to assume that he best
strategy will be random walk and that continuing to search for a more accurate
prediction strategy will likely be a fruitless process.

This seems to support that time series with low to moderate complexity ($0\le WPE \le 0.85$) can be predicted more efficiently than a na\"ive random walk \emph{and} that complexity can be qualitatively measured for a real-valued noisy time series using WPE. This will allow practitioners to stop spinning their wheels in the case of signals who are simply better predicted with a simple strategy like random walk. 



%%Now switch form the existence of structure as signaled by WPE to the type of structure 

[[Joshua: Merge the following 2 paragraphs.]]

Figure \ref{fig:lma_vs_arima} also elucidates another fact: usable predictive structure can be present in a time series without a prediction scheme being able to utilize it. In particular, information may be transferring from past to future through the present but because of the mechanism the underlying processe uses to process that information  (e.g., linear or nonlinear) particular prediction strategies may be blind to or not be able to efficiently utilize this information. For example, consider \col, programs like this have been shown to exhibit deterministic chaos \cite{mytkowicz09}. If this were the case with \col, an out-of-the-box linear method like ARIMA would simply be ill-equipped to model and utilize the kind of structure present as is evident in Figure \ref{fig:lma_vs_arima} (b). In contrast, a nonlinear predictor like LMA which is built to handle deterministic chaos can interpret and utilize this type of structure just fine. We believe that many of the shifts in accuracy for low-to-moderate WPE programs between ARIMA and LMA is precisely happening for this reason: Just because there is forward information transfer, does not mean that linear predictors can get at this, but luckily WPE can tell us when this structure is present as shown in Figure \ref{fig:lma_vs_arima}.


The WPE is sensitive to both linear and nonlinear structure. When you have a low
WPE and a high ARIMA it could be that the structure WPE is picking up is simply
nonlinear structure that LMA can handle but ARIMA cannot. So while the ARIMA
prediction look really bad there is plenty of structure present as suggested by
WPE and taken advantage of by LMA but since it is nonlinear ARIMA can't take it
into account and does bad.

Other noteworthy features of the LMA and ARIMA results are the cluster locations
and distributions. The WPE values of each run any particular program tend to
have little variance, leading to the clusters in
Figures~\ref{fig:arima_pred_vs_wpe}, \ref{fig:lma_pred_vs_wpe} to be fairly
constrained in the $y$ direction. For most traces, the LMA and ARIMA variance is
low too, resulting is small, tight clusters. The ARIMA MASE values of the \col
traces, however, have a large variance resulting in the spread seen in
Fig~\ref{fig:arima_pred_vs_wpe}. Not only are the MASE values of that cluster
bad, in that other predictors vastly outperform it, but they are inconsistent.
Furthermore, since LMA can predict nonlinear behavior while ARIMA can not, we
see that the clusters in Fig.~\ref{fig:arima_pred_vs_wpe} are mostly further to
the right than those in Fig.~\ref{fig:lma_pred_vs_wpe}.






%The structure being picked up on by WPE may be linear or nonlinear. When you have a low WPE and a high ARIMA it could be that the structure WPE is picking up is simply nonlinear structure that LMA can handle but ARIMA cannot. So while the ARIMA prediction look realy bad there is plenty of structure present as suggested by WPE and taken advantage of by LMA but since it is nonlinear ARIMA can't take it into account and does bad.

% In Table~\ref{tab:TCMpe} \& \ref{tab:IPCpe} the behavior of the PEs as

\section{ Conclusions \& Future Work}\label{sec:conc}

The results presented here suggest that permutation entropy---a ordinal
calculation of forward information transfer in a time series---is an effective
metric for predictability of computer performance traces. Experimentally, traces
with a persistent PE $\gtrapprox 0.97$ have a natural level of complexity that
may overshadow the inherent determinism in the system dynamics, whereas traces
with PE $\lessapprox 0.7$ seem to be highly predictable (viz., at least an order
of magnitude improvement in nRMSPE).Further, the persistent WPE values of 0.5--
0.6 for the {\tt col\_major} trace are consistent with dynamical chaos, further
corroborating the results of~\cite{mytkowicz09}.

If information is the limit, then gathering and using more information is an
obvious next step.  There is an equally obvious tension here between data length
and prediction speed: a forecast that requires half a second to compute is not
useful for the purposes of real-time control of a computer system with a MHz
clock rate.  Another alternative is to sample several system variables
simultaneously and build multivariate delay-coordinate embeddings.  Existing
approaches to that are computationally prohibitive
\cite{cao-multivariate-embedding}.  We are working on alternative
methods that sidestep that complexity.

%%This use of permutaiotn entropy is a useful application of information
%%theory to computer performance modeling because it gives you a simple
%%and fast way to decide whether building a model and trying to forecast
%%the future is worthwhile or if guessing the mean is just as effective.
%%End with a sentence tying back to power management and world peace.
